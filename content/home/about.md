# About

I am currently a student working on the Marketing with Concentration in Digital Marketing certificate at UCLA Extension. I received my Masters in Psychology at the California State University, Fullerton in 2017.

After working in the field as a Behavior Specialist and conducting independent research at CSUF, my attention shifted towards Marketing. I wanted to apply my background in psychology in a business context and found that the field of Marketing best aligned with my goals and interests. I hope to work in a creative environment where I can assist in the development and launching of different exciting campaigns.
