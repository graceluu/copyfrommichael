# About Me

Hi, thanks for stopping by!

I am currently a student working on the Marketing with Concentration in Digital Marketing certificate at UCLA Extension. I worked as a Behavior Specialist for several years, but I slowly realized that my passion was elsewhere. I wanted to apply my background in psychology in a business context and found that the field of Marketing best aligned with my goals and interest in the entertainment industry and media.

If you were to ask me to describe myself, I would say I am self-motivated, resourceful and diligent. But, how do these words translate into my work? Well, this website is a good example. 

This is my first website, which admittedly means I lacked knowledge in creating and launching a website. However, I am diligent and patient in seeing things through. Over a few days, I watched YouTube videos, searched Google for answers, read sections of "blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown" on how to launch a website. It was challenging, but through many trials and errors, I learned how to use GitHub and Netlify to operate graceluu.com. I believe with any challenge, persistence and patience will be rewarded. 

That's all the tidbit about me for now. Check out other sections of my website or contact me through LinkedIn or email if you would like to know more. If you believe I am an ideal candidate for a job or internship opportunity, don't hesitate to send an email my way.
