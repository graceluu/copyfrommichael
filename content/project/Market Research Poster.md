# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "Generic brand items are often priced lower, but is label a sure indication of poor quality? Brand and price are major contributors to consumer purchase and sales. However, without brand labeling, consumers are left to only examine price. This study explored the instance when the brand is not available or unfamiliar to the consumer and the only available information is the price. &nbsp;The experiment focused on the effects of price on the perception taste. &nbsp;Particularly, whether perceived quality increased with the price."
