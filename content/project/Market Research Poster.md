summary = "There are many factors that influence one&rsquo;s perceived quality of an item or service; one of the most studied is brand popularity. Research has been done on the effect of brand labeling compared to generic, on perceived quality and consumer purchasing choice.
<p>Generic brand items are often priced lower, but is label a sure indication of poor quality? Brand and price are major contributors to consumer purchase and sales. However, without brand labeling, consumers are left to only examine price.</p>
<p>This study explored the instance when the brand is not available or unfamiliar to the consumer and the only available information is the price. &nbsp;The experiment focused on the effects of price on the perception taste. &nbsp;Particularly, whether perceived quality increased with the price.</p>"
