# Project summary to display on homepage.
summary = "There are many factors that influence one&rsquo;s perceived quality of an item or service; one of the most studied is brand popularity. Research has been done on the effect of brand labeling compared to generic, on perceived quality and consumer purchasing choice. Generic brand items are often priced lower, but is label a sure indication of poor quality? Brand and price are major contributors to consumer purchase and sales. However, without brand labeling, consumers are left to only examine price. This study explored the instance when the brand is not available or unfamiliar to the consumer and the only available information is the price. &nbsp;The experiment focused on the effects of price on the perception taste. &nbsp;Particularly, whether perceived quality increased with the price."
